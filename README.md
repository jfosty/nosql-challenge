# nosql-challenge - Jennifer Foster 

Challenge due 1/6/2025. 
I referenced the Skeleton Code and some instructions from Mongodb to install the correct import functions. 
There are two files: 
 1. Setup 
 2. Analysis 

Setup has some initial adding of a restaurant and the reformatting of long, lat coordinates, etc. 

Analysis has the requested analysis relating to hygiene.

I put the import mongo code in both files, but it is only needed once in the set-up file.
